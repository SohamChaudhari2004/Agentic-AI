### **Important Notes:**
1. **CAGR vs. 1-Year Return**
   - CAGR is typically calculated over **3-5 years**, but for **1-year performance**, we use **absolute returns**.
   - If you need **true CAGR (3-5 years)**, adjust the filters accordingly.

2. **Data is Dynamic**
   - Stock prices change daily, so **recheck before investing**.

3. **High Returns = High Risk**
   - Stocks with >10% 1-year returns may be volatile. Do **fundamental analysis** before investing.

4. **ETFs & Indices**
   - If you want **diversified exposure**, consider **ETFs** like:
     - **India:** **Nifty 50 ETF (NIFTYBEES)** (~20% 1-year return)
     - **US:** **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)** (~25% 1-year return)

---

### **How to Calculate CAGR Manually**
If you have the **starting price (P₀)** and **ending price (P₁)** for **1 year**, use:
\[
\text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{P₁}{P₀} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
\]
Where:
- \( n = 1 \) (for 1 year)
- Example: If a stock went from **₹100 to ₹110** in 1 year:
  \[
  \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{110}{100} \right)^1 - 1 = 10\%
  \]

---

### **Final Recommendation**
- **For Indian stocks:** Use **Screener.in** or **Moneycontrol**.
- **For US stocks:** Use **Finviz** or **Yahoo Finance**.
- **For backtesting:** Use **TradingView** or **Google Finance**.
